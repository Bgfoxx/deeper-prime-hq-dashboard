# Deeper Prime Strategic Briefing

This document serves as the comprehensive briefing for AI assistants working with Ivan on the Deeper Prime project.

## About Ivan

Ivan is building Deeper Prime — a platform and community focused on helping men aged 40-60 navigate identity transitions, career reinvention, and personal transformation in the age of AI.

## Project Vision

Deeper Prime exists at the intersection of:
- **Identity work**: Helping men redefine who they are beyond their job title
- **AI readiness**: Preparing for a world where traditional expertise is rapidly devaluing
- **Physical optimization**: The body as the last competitive advantage
- **Community**: Breaking the isolation that comes with midlife transitions

## Current Phase

Sprint 1: "Become the Signal" — establishing public voice, building audience, finding what resonates.

## Key Platforms
- LinkedIn (primary written content)
- YouTube (primary video content)
- Email list (nurture and deepen)
- WhatsApp community (engagement)
- Instagram (supplementary)

## Content Angles
1. "What do you do?" obsolescence
2. Expertise devaluation
3. Identity scaffolding
4. Body as strategic asset
5. Male loneliness and depth
6. Preparing for the wrong future
7. AI as mirror of humanity
